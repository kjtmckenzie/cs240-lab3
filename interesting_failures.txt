#This file is for noting interesting failure cases we've detected.

#Inject ENOMEM into 5th-and-on mmap calls within seemingly any program -> hangs with no message.
./tracer_sample 9 -12 0 -s 5 make

#Or when breaking on mmap and brk with ENOMEM:
./tracer_sample 9,12 -12,-12 0 -s 6 make
./tracer_sample 9,12 -12,-12 0 -s 6 "echo 'hi'"

#Can show that it definitely catches application-specific responses to syscall failures:
./tracer_sample 9,12 -12,-12 0 -s 8 make

#If the memory stops coming at calls between 60-100ish, vim dies with a segfault (possibly leaving the terminal messed up).
./tracer_sample 9,12 -12,-12 -1 0 1 0 0 0 skip 60 'vim vimtest.txt'

#Infinite python error loop!
./bin/injector 9,12 -12,-12 -1 0 1 0 0 0 skip 100 '/usr/bin/python'
#After starting python like this, enter help, then help() to enter interactive help, then exit it with ctrl-D.
